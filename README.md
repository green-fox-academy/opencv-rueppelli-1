## OUR MISSION  :oncoming_automobile: :camera: :computer:  :recycle:
The purpose of the team is to help computers to understand the world as we see it. More precisely we are going to
process pictures and videos from car Dash Cams and transport situations and try to make decisions based on that.
These camera systems slowly but surely are getting a huge part in nowadays automobile industry (because only one
camera can replace numerous sensors), this is why we are focusing only on transporting.
For that we are going to use OpenCV to process the camera input with C++.

On this week:
Now we are building the framework of our project and getting acquainted with the opencv's mystery.
