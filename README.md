## NOW
Our tasks are now about we analize pictures, clear them and calculating their area, find their middle and give back
the coordinates.


## OUR FINAL GOAL
Our final goal to create a program which can analize the traffic signboards, measure the car speed and can give back
the data to the car's panel. For example by the sense signboards you can see on your panel a red exclamation mark
beside your actual speed, when you drive fast.
